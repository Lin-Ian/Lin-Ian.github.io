          <div class="intro">
            <p>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</p>
            <p>
              My name is Ian and I'm a third-year Mechatronics Engineering
              student studying at the University of Waterloo.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm interested in the field of machine learning, artificial
              intelligence, and web development.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm skilled in using Python (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn),
              C/C++, SQL, NoSQL (MongoDB), HTML/CSS, and Power BI. I also have
              experience in using Python (NLTK, OpenCV, Keras, Flask),
              JavaScript (React.js, Node.js), and R.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my own time I like going on nature walks, listening to
              music, learning new technical skills, swimming, working out, and
              practicing playing the cello.
