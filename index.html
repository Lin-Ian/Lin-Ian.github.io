          <div class="intro">
            <p>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</p>
            <p>
              My name is Ian and I'm a fourth-year Mechatronics Engineering
              student studying at the University of Waterloo.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm interested in the fields of machine learning, artificial
              intelligence, and data science.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm skilled programming with Python (pandas, matplotlib,
              scikit-learn, NLTK, PySpark, Keras, TensorFlow, Flask, Tkinter),
              C/C++, SQL, NoSQL (MongoDB), HTML/CSS, R, MATLAB. I've also used
              Git, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Power BI, Microsoft Access, and
              Figma.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              During my own time I enjoy going on nature walks, listening to
              music, learning new technical skills, swimming, working out,
              drawing, and playing the cello.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here you'll see some of my more creative work here:
