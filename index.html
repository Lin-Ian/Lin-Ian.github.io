          <div class="intro">
            <p>Hi there,</p>
            <p>
              I'm a second-year Mechatronics Engineering student studying at the
              University of Waterloo.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of my interests include data science, web development and
              machine learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm skilled in using Python (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn),
              C++, SQL, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Power BI. I also have
              experience in using NLTK, OpenCV, Keras, NoSQL, and R.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of work and school I like to spend my time listening to
              music, learning new technical skills, swim, workout, and practice
              playing the cello.
            </p>
